  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

      title={Bridging Neural ODE and ResNet: A Formal Error Bound for Safety Verification}, 
      author={Abdelrahman Sayed preview={brownian-motion.gif}Sayed and Pierre-Jean Meyer and Mohamed Ghazel},
      abstract={A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning model that is commonly described as a continuousdepth generalization of a residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.},
