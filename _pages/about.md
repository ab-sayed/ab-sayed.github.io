My research focuses on developing tools/methods for formal verification of neural ODE using reachability analysis. My broader interest lie in AI controlled systems, control theorey, and formal methods.

Currently, I am a PhD researcher in [ESTAS lab](https://estas.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/english/estas) at [Université Gustave Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/), where I am advised by [Pierre-Jean Meyer](http://chapal.eu/pierre-jean_meyer/) and [Mohamed Ghazel](https://pagespro.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/mohamed-ghazel). I am also co-advised by [Asgeir J. Sørensen](https://assor.folk.ntnu.no/) from [NTNU Deprtartment of Marine Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/imt). Previously, I was an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s degree scholar in [Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR)](https://www.master-mir.eu/), with a specialization in Safe Autonomous subsea operations between [Université de Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) in France and [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Norway, and I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering specializing in Robotics, Systems, and Control, from [Nile University](https://www.nu.edu.eg/), Egypt.
